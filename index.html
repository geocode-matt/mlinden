                        <br>
                        I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am actively seeking employment as a Web/Software Developer in the DFW, Houston, or Austin, Texas areas. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Background:
                        I began the web development program through UT Austin with the original intention of applying these skills to improve workflows and processes at the company I was working for (Rio Oil and Gas II). Economic hardships brought about by Covid-19 led to the collapse of Rio but, refreshingly, has reignited my passion for programming and led me to a total dedication to becoming a full-time developer. My aspiration is to utilize the foundational technical and problem-solving skills I have developed during my ~10 years as a geoscientist to pursue a career in full stack web development.
